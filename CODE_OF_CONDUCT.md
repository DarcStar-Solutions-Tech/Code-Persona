# Project Code of Conduct

## Introduction
This Code of Conduct is designed to support a harmonious and productive environment where all contributors feel valued and able to freely share their ideas. This project involves developing multiple generative AI agents to create code through a web interface.

## Standards

**1. Respect:**
Everyone is entitled to an environment free of harassment, discrimination, and disrespectful behavior. Personal attacks, offensive comments, or hate speech will not be tolerated.

**2. Professionalism:**
Conduct yourself professionally. Use inclusive language, provide useful, constructive feedback, and keep discussions on topic.

**3. Collaboration:**
Work together as a team. Encourage cooperation rather than competition. Be open to different viewpoints and consider others' ideas seriously.

**4. Quality:**
Strive for excellence and consistency in all contributions. Write clean, clear code, and thoroughly review and test your work before submitting.

**5. Security:**
Given the nature of this project, be highly attentive to the AI's generation of code. It should not produce code that violates any laws, infringes on privacy, or poses any security threats.

## Responsibilities

Maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

**2. Contributors:**
Contributors are expected to follow this Code of Conduct in all project spaces. If you notice any violation of this Code, please report it to the project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Violations of this Code of Conduct may result in the offender being temporarily or permanently banned from contributing. This will be at the discretion of the project maintainers.

## Reporting

If you are subject to or witness any violations of this Code of Conduct, please contact the project maintainers with a description of the incident. All reports will be handled with discretion.
