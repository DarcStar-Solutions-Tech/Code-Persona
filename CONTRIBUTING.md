## Development Workflow

We follow a trunk-based development workflow. Here's what that looks like:

1. **Pull the latest changes:** Always pull the latest changes from the main branch before you start your work.

2. **Create a new branch:** For each new feature or bug fix, create a new branch. Your branch name should describe the feature or bug fix you're implementing.

3. **Make your changes:** Implement your feature or bug fix in your branch.

4. **Write tests:** Ensure you write adequate tests that cover your changes. This ensures that your changes do what they're supposed to and that future changes won't break your feature.

5. **Ensure the code style matches the project's:** We maintain a consistent code style throughout the project. Make sure your code adheres to this style.

6. **Push to your fork:** Once you have completed your changes and they meet the above criteria, push the changes to your fork.

7. **Create a Pull Request:** From your forked repository, create a pull request to the main branch.

8. **Code review:** Your pull request will be reviewed by the project maintainers. They may ask you to make changes to your pull request. Please respond in a timely manner to keep the project moving.

9. **Merge:** Once your pull request is approved, it will be merged into the main branch.
